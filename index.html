                <p>Happy one month anniversary miggie :3, I love you so much and want to thank you for being in my life not as a friend but as a lover. I enjoy every bit of time I spend with you and I’ve never smiled so much talking to someone because of how much we bond and make stupid jokes. I still can’t fathom how it was so awkward the first day we met but became close friends afterwards, especially since you shit your pants the first day we met… anyways I hope we spend more months and even years together because I couldn’t imagine being with anyone else besides you. I know we have our arguments but we always make up and get through it but besides that we have more good moments than bad. I just wanted to say to that you are the most smartest (even though you deny it), beautiful, funny, loving person I know and that will never change. p.s your gifts will come soon :)</p>
